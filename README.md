Files for a First-Person Horror Game in Unreal Engine 4.21
These files include the work done in Unreal Engine on a horror game that I personally made/manipulated.
Many files are left out that involve other aspects of aesthetic design such as meshes, textures, etc.
Feel free to add upon these files or simply use them as a reference when starting on any project in Unreal Engine 4.21.
This was made for the purposes of a Senior Thesis for college and no advice or contact will be necessary.
This serves as a reference to my work or for anyone willing to import these files into a project of their own. 
Documentation involving the project's research and other areas of development can be found online at the Willamette Hatfield Library.
Thank you and I hope anything here can be a good reference or starter for any projects attempted in Unreal Engine 4.21.
